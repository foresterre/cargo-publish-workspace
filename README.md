# cargo-publish-workspace

## Goals

* Publish workspace packages to crates.io with a single command.
* Support the package versioning scheme where all packages have the same major and minor version number.
* Contribute to enhanced release automation, so releasing a new version takes less time, which enables us to release more often,
 and with smaller increments.

## Command & options

```
cargo-publish-workspace
Topologically publish a complete workspace

All arguments provided after two dashes (--) will be passed on to 'cargo publish'. This means, if
cargo publish-workspace itself doesn't support a flag related to publishing a cargo crate (yet), you
can still use this method. For example, you may use a custom registry with the following command
`cargo publish-workspace <..options> -- --registry <registry>`. The '--registry <registry>'
arguments will be passed to cargo publish. Note: some arguments are also passed on by cargo publish-
workspace, in which case, if also provided after the two dashes may be passed on twice. For example,
this would be the case if we would run: `cargo publish-workspace <...options> --no-verify -- --no-
verify`.

USAGE:
    cargo publish-workspace [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] --new-version <new-version>

FLAGS:
        --dry-run
            Simulate running this program

    -h, --help
            Prints help information

        --no-verify
            Don't build the crate before publishing

    -V, --version
            Prints version information


OPTIONS:
        --manifest <manifest>
            The workspace manifest file, usually the root Cargo.toml [default: Cargo.toml]

        --new-version <new-version>
            The version to which all workspace crates will be updated

        --sleep <sleep>
            The amount of seconds to sleep between publishing of workspace packages

            Allows the index to update [default: 5]

## Examples

Update packages in workspace to `0.17.0`, without verifying before publish. Sleep 15 seconds between publishing of packages, so the crates.io registry has time to refresh.
```
cargo publish-workspace --sleep 15 --no-verify --new-version 0.17.0
```
